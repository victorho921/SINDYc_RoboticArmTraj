# SINDYc_RoboticArmTraj

# This is a Control Project that utilize Data Driven Control Algorithm to create a mathematics model of a physical system.
# This project is to find out the kinematics relationship of robotic arm end-effector with joint angles using Sparse Inverse Nonlinear Dynamics with Control Algorithm by Steven L. Bunton

# This Github repository includes C++ code that used to generate Panada robotic arm data with Moveit2 package.
